        "Git is a version control system invented by Linus Torvalds, the\n",
        "invetor of the linux operating system. A github repository is a\n",
        "directory that the software git is using to keep track of\n",
        "versions. Install\n",
        "[git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git),\n",
        "it's already installed on most cloud services and many operaiting\n",
        "systems.  You can initialize a repository in a directory with the\n",
        "command `git init` in that directory. Honestly, I almost never start a\n",
        "git repo this way, because I've connected my repo to a cloud\n",
        "server. But, more on that later. After you've initialized it, your git\n",
        "repo is a locally version controlled system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Adding files\n",
        "\n",
        "OK, now you want to add some of your files to your repo. You have a\n",
        "directory You can add files with the command\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "git add FILENAME\n",
        "```\n",
        "The file `FILENAME` is now staged to be part of the repository, but isn't \n",
        "added yet!  Files that you haven't added won't be tracked. This is\n",
        "good, since there's many files, llike log files, that we don't want to\n",
        "track.  You only need to add the files once, then they are being\n",
        "tracked. Try it out with a readme markdown file in your repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Checking status\n",
        "One of the most useful git commands is \n",
        "```\n",
        "git status\n",
        "```\n",
        "This gives the status of which files are being tracked, which are not and which have changes.\n",

        "them represented. Committing changes is a local operation,\n",
        "subsequently, we'll show you how to coordinate with a remote\n",
        "repository. Here's the command I use to commit most often\n",

        "git commit -a -m \"COMMIT MESSAGE\"\n",
        "``` \n",

        "The `-m \"COMMIT MESSAGE\"` is the message associated with your\n",
        "commit. Make your commit messages more informative. If you don't add\n",

        "### Remote repositories\n",
        "Git becomes much more useful when it's coordinated with a remote\n",
        "repository. Github is a server for hosting remote git repositories,\n",
        "there are several others, bitbucket is an example. Github also\n",

        "You often want multiple versions of a repository. For example, you might want a development version, a working version and a stable version. This is what branches are for in git. To create and switch to a branch called `dev`, use:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "git checkout -b dev\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This creates a new branch called `dev` and switches to that branch. If you already have `dev`, use `checkout` without `-b`. Suppose you want to merge your change from `dev` into your default branch (`main`)\n",

        "\n",
        "If you want to connect to a remote repository to github on a unix or linux system, it's probably easiest to set up using so called secure shell. You can also set it up a variety of ways on Windows, but the rules are a little less universal. If you find this very hard to follow, just use a git and github gui (like github desktop, which is what I like to recommend).\n",
        "\n",
        "Secure shell works as follows. It creates a public key (think like a lock, everyone can see it) and a private key (like the key for the lock, only you have it). When you connect to github, it has your public key and you use the private key to \"unlock\" it. First, you need a `.ssh` directory from your personal directory. If you don't have that, try `ssh username@server` to a server that you know and it will automatically create one.  \n",

        "we'll go through [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) tutorial.\n",

        "Then, cd into your `.ssh` director and type the following and follow the instructions\n",
        "```\n",
        "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "This generates your public/prviate key pair. Then you need to take the public key file, and upload it to github under settings. This is described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).\n",

        "\n",
        "In some cases I've also had to add this to a file `config` in my `.ssh` directory:\n",

        "\n",
        "It's possible to host web pages on github. By *hosting* I mean serving the web page on the internet so that others can view it. There's a couple of steps to doing this. First, you need an html file to serve. If you look in [the chapter](https://smart-stats.github.io/ds4bio_book/book/_build/html/html.html) on html, there's the code for a basic wepage. Save a web page as say \"index.html\". You can double check that it works by simply double clicking on the file on your local computer. It should display as a web page in your browser, but it's only viewable by you. Notice the addres begins with `file:///...`. To serve the file so that others can view it, we need it to exist on a server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Github will serve the file for us, but first we need a repository. Create a public repository; I typically do this on github. Then you need to add an empty file called `.nojekyll`. Don't forget the period at the beginning. This prevents github from thinking you're using the [jekyll framework](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is the default. Since we're serving a basic webpage, we don't need this framework. I create this file on github just by clicking *Add File* then *Create new file*. \n",
        "\n",
        "Next we need to tell github that this repo serves web pages. Click on *settings* then *pages* on the left. Then, under *source* choose the branch that you want to serve the pages from. Add your html file, commit and push to github. Give it a few minutes, then your file will be served from \n",

        "where here `GITHUBUSERNAME` is either your github username or the organization. `REPONAME` is the name of your repository and `FILENAME.html` is your html file, with the path if it's in subdirectories. As an example, here's a version I did [https://bcaffo.github.io/testHtmlRepo/index.html](https://bcaffo.github.io/testHtmlRepo/index.html). \n"
