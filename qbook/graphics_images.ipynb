        "Images broadly come in two types, vector and raster. Vector graphics are in formats like pdf, eps, svg and raster graphics are like jpeg, gif, png. Vector graphics store the image constructs and shapes. So, a vector graphics renderer can zoom in indefinitely on a shape and its edges will appear sharp. Vector fonts work this way. Raster graphics basically store a matrix and the pixels on the screen show the values of that matrix. Bitmapped fonts work this way. Of course, vector graphics have to be converted to raster to be actually displayed by the computer. Finally, some rater graphics formats have compression, which we won't really discuss.\n",

        "Raster images are typically stored as an array. Grayscale images are matrices with the image intensity as the value and color pictures are stored as 3D arrays with the two main dimensions and color channels. A library for working with regular images in python is called PIL. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are different raster specifications. RGB has 3 color channels, red, green and blue. CMYK has four: cyan, magenta, yellow and black. It's interesting to note that the use of color channels existed before color cameras, when photographers would use different filters and additive and subtractive processes. The photograph below was created in 1877 by Louis Ducos du Hauron. \n",

For example, the convolution of densities or mass functions is the respective density or mass function for the sum of random variables from those distributions. In applied data analysis, you can think of the convolution between $X$ and $K$ as *smearing* the function $K$ over the function $X$. Thus, it plays a key role in smoothing. Let's try an example using the covid data and a box kernel.  We take $K(t) = I\\{0 \\leq t < M\\} / M$ (i.e. is 1 for times 0 to $M-1$, then rescaled so it sums to 1). Assume that $N\\geq M$ and that $X(t)$ and $K(t)$ are $0$ and for $t < 0$ or $t > N$. Then, our convolution works out to be\n",

So, the convolution, as we've defined it, at point $t$ is the moving average at point $t + (M-1)/2$ (ie. it's shifted by $(M-1)/2$). Also, at the end ($t \\geq N - M + 1$), we're averaging in the assumed zero values of the $X$. This might be reasonable to do, or maybe not. The fact that we're padding the end and not the beginning is just because of the range of index values we defined the kernel on. We'd have the same problem only on the other end if $K(t) = I(-M < t \\leq 0)/M$. Of course, the computer will start summing things at index 0 regardless. However, it can shift the kernel relative to the signal arbitrarily by zero padding one end or the other or both. A reasonable strategy is to set it so that\n",

Numpy has options to shift the convolution back into the same space as the original signal for you (i.e. has $N$ points, `mode = \"same\"`). Or, you can just do it yourself if you do `mode = \"full\"`, just shift by $(M-1)/2$. Similarly shift for `mode = \"valid\"` (but the convolution has fewer points in this case, so it won't have corresponding points with $X$ at the very beginning and end).\n",

This is typically done to denoise an image (to blur out the noise). Let's try it on a cartoon image of Brian. We'll just stick to a black and white image so that it's 2D. A color image has 3 color channels, so is a 3D array. (However, you see the patten; you should be able to extend this to 3D with little problem.)"
