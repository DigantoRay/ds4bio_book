He states that the pain began the day before and consisted of a sharp pain that lasted around 30 seconds, followed by a dull pain that would last around 2 minutes. The pain was located over his left chest area somewhat near his shoulder. The onset of pain came while the patient was walking in his home. He did not sit and rest during the pain, but continued to do household chores. Later on in the afternoon he went to the gym where he walked 1 mile on the treadmill, rode the bike for 5 minutes, and swam in the pool. After returning from the gym he did some work out in the yard, cutting back some vines. He did not have any reoccurrences of chest pain while at the gym or later in the evening. The following morning (of his presentation to the ED) he noticed the pain as he was getting out of bed. Once again it was a dull pain, preceded by a short interval of a sharp pain. The patient did experience some tingling in his right arm after the pain ceased. He continued to have several episodes of the pain throughout the morning, so his daughter-in-law decided to take him to the ED around 12:30pm. The painful episodes did not increase in intensity or severity during this time. At the ED the patient was given nitroglycerin, which he claims helped alleviate the pain somewhat. HPI has not experienced any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis during these episodes of pain. He has never had chest pain in the past. He has been told ‚Äúyears ago‚Äù that he has a right bundle branch block and premature heart beats.\"\"\""
