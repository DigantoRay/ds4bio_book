A couple of things to take note of. First, python uses the white space instead of inclosing the statement in braces or parentheses. Secondly, don't forget the colons after programming statements like `if`, `else`, `for`, `def` and so on. Otherwise, if/else statements work just like you'd expect."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8ff1mkP6DXxy","outputId":"d133f660-bb71-42a4-c988-58e703c708ba"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Gryffindor\n"]}],"source":["# do this if you'd like to prompt for an input\n","# x = input(\"are you mean (y/n)? > \")\n","# Let's just assume the user input 'n'\n","x = 'n'\n","if x == 'y':\n"," print(\"Slytherine!\")\n","else:\n"," print(\"Gryffindor\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ckkmGtCJDXx4"},"source":["Just to further describe white space useage in python, consider testing whether `statementA` is True.
