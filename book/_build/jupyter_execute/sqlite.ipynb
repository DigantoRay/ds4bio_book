    "# SQL via sqlite\n",
    "\n",
    "In this page, we'll cover some of the basics of SQL (structured querry language) by working through some examples. SQL is a set of language standards for databases, so we have to choose a specific implementation. We'll use sqlite for this purpose. As its name implies, sqlite is a small implementation of SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my linux implementation, sqlite3 was pre-installed. [Here's](https://www.guru99.com/download-install-sqlite.html) a tutorial on installing for windows. Sqlite3 is a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first create a database at the command line. Notice when we create a file\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "command prompt> sqlite3 class.db\n",
    "sqlite> create table class(id int primary key, lname text,fname)\n",
    "sqlite> insert into class values (1, \"Wayne\", \"Bruce\");\n",
    "sqlite> insert into class values (2, \"Jennifer\", \"Walters\");\n",
    "sqlite> .header on\n",
    "sqlist> .mode column\n",
    "sqlite> select * from class;\n",
    "id  lname     fname  \n",
    "--  --------  -------\n",
    "1   Wayne     Bruce  \n",
    "2   Jennifer  Walters\n",
    "sqlite> .quit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The command `sqlite3 class.db` opens up the database, in this case creating a new one, and then enters into th sqlite command line.\n",
    "* The command `create ...` creates our table within our database\n",
    "* The `insert ...` commands insert two records\n",
    "* The `.header ...` and `.mode ...` commands format output\n",
    "* The `select ...` command grabs all records\n",
    "* Then `.quit` just quits the commmand line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing an `ls` in the current working directory now shows the file `class.db`.  Everything else we discuss below assumes working in the sqlite command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with sqlite, it's nice to work with a development environment specifically created for sql. Specifically, one with nice highlighting and autocompletion. Since I'm writing these notes in jupyter, I'm just pasting code output.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to use magic commands (like `%%sql` ) to use sqlite in jupyter cells. However, some of the sql commands are not allowed (like the pragma commands). Personally, I find this to be more trouble thant it's worth. So I would suggest just using python, which has nice sql APIs if one wants to work in jupyter lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sqlite has SQL commands, which must be typed with a semicolon at the end, and sqlite specific commands, which begin with a period and the `pragma` commands, which are also sqlite specific. This is good to remember, since some things will be portable to other SQL implementations and others not.\n",
