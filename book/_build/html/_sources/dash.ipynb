Dash is more popular among the python focused, while shiny, a related platform, is more popular among R focused, but also applies much more broadly than just for R apps.\n","\n","Because we're focusing on python as our base language, we'll focus on dash. There's a wonderful set of tutorials [here](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction). Follow the instructions there on installation. We'll build a simple app here building on that tutorial. Let's take the first plotly example and use one of our examples.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0057baf8-d288-48ba-baae-7f58b75ea88c","metadata":{"id":"0057baf8-d288-48ba-baae-7f58b75ea88c"},"source":["Put this code below in a file, say dashApp.py (in the github repo it's in `assetts/dash`), then run it with `python dashApp.py`.
