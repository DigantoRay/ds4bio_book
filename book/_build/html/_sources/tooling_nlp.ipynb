The following morning (of his presentation to the ED) he noticed the pain as he was getting out of bed. Once again it was a dull pain, preceded by a short interval of a sharp pain. The patient did experience some tingling in his right arm after the pain ceased. He continued to have several episodes of the pain throughout the morning, so his daughter-in-law decided to take him to the ED around 12:30pm.
