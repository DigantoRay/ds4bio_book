This chapter is a low level teaser of data structures geared towards students who haven't been exposed to the ideas much at all. Let's use our new knowledge of R to think about building a classic datastructure that exists in python (dictionary) in R.\n","\n","## Hash tables\n","A common starting point for data structures is a hash table. Suppose we want to store a set of `values` associated with a set of `keys`. Consider a list of some students and their PhD theses.\n","\n","| key | value |\n","|:----|:------|\n","| Leena    | Modelling biomedical data and the foundations of bioequivalence|\n","| Xianbin  | Modeling composite outcomes and their component parts |\n","| Shu-Chih | Structure/function relationships in the analysis of anatomical and functional neuroimaging data|\n","| Haley | Statistical methods for inter-subject analysis of neuroscience data |\n","| Bruce | From individuals to populations: application and insights concerning the generalized linear mixed model|\n","\n","If we stored these in an text array, say, and we wanted to look up Bruce's thesis title, we'd have to check each key in turn until we arived at Bruce and then looked up his thesis. This has a worst case scenario of n operations. (Question, if we looked in the order of a random permutation, what is the expected number of lookups?)\n","\n","Hash tables map the keys to a specific lookup number. Thus, when trying to find Bruce's value, the has function would perform `hash(\"Bruce\")` to get the hash value, then to straight to that point in the array. Sounds great!\n","\n","There are some details, of course. Most (all) programming languages have hash tables, or libraries that add on hash tables. For example, the `dict` structure in python. Since that exists, let's work in R and create our own hash table. (Note R has libraries that create hash tables and the list structure in R can reference by keynames or list index.)\n","\n","We need a hash function. Let's create one as the sum of its utf8 values"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"r"},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":69},"id":"XRV56tWefos9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713230627602,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":278,"user":{"displayName":"Brian Caffo","userId":"07979705296072332292"}},"outputId":"607c17b0-dcf8-49ea-f907-5cdf9dcca05e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["2"],"text/markdown":"2","text/latex":"2","text/plain":["[1] 2"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["2"],"text/markdown":"2","text/latex":"2","text/plain":["[1] 2"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["4"],"text/markdown":"4","text/latex":"4","text/plain":["[1] 4"]},"metadata":{}}],"source":["hash = function(string, mod) sum(utf8ToInt(string)) %% mod\n","hash(\"Bruce\", 5)\n","hash(\"Bruce2\", 5)\n","hash(\"Haley\", 5)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G0RpKVXUfotJ"},"source":["Here the mod is used to truncate our integer value so that our it fits in our list.
