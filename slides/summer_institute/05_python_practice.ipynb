    "The examples we've seen so far are foundational, but real-world data programming in Python often looks quite different. In practice, we rely heavily on modules that enhance our ability to work with complex data science objects. Most Python objects are class objects, equipped with a variety of methods that simplify manipulation and analysis. This object-oriented approach lets us apply powerful built-in methods directly to our data, making our code more efficient and expressive. A good coding environment will typically offer method autocompletion for these objects, which helps to avoid typos and speeds up coding by suggesting available methods as you type."

    "Let's see Python in practice with a list of pets: ['frogs', 'cats', 'dogs', 'hamsters']. Initially, printing the list shows the original order. Using pets.sort() sorts the list alphabetically, modifying the list directly. The pets.reverse() method then reverses the sorted list. Next, pets.pop() removes the last item from the list. We then use pets.append('horses') to add 'horses' to the end of the list. Finally, pets.count('horses') tells us how many times 'horses' appears in the list. This example highlights how Python’s list methods allow for dynamic and intuitive data manipulation."

We store these values in self.r and self.i. We include a conjugate method that modifies the object's imaginary part by negating it. Finally, the print method displays the complex number as a tuple. In our example, we create a complex number y = mycomplex(10, 5), print it, then call y.conjugate() to modify its imaginary part and print it again.

For example, creating y = mycomplex(10, 5) and calling y.conjugate() gives us a new complex number z without modifying y. When we print both y and z, y remains (10, 5), and z is (10, -5). This approach preserves immutability, which can be beneficial for maintaining the integrity of our data."
